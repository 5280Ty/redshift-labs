## Project Index  
Each entry below includes a short summary and a quick snapshot of what the project demonstrates. Full walkthroughs live inside each project’s folder.

### **1. OWASP Juice Shop Pentest (Completed)**  
A black box assessment against OWASP Juice Shop. I approached it like a real engagement, not a scavenger hunt. Enumeration, exploitation, post‑exploitation, and challenge completion were all done manually, with only one request modified in Burp.  

**Snapshot:**  
- Black box methodology  
- Recon and page discovery  
- Manual exploitation paths  
- Accidental multi‑star challenge solves  
- OSINT on internal users  
- Analysis of risk and impact

**Walkthrough:** See  `Juice-Shop-Series/Walkthrough1.md`

## About This Series  
Each project is meant to stand on its own and also show a clear progression through offensive concepts. These aren’t “I watched someone on YouTube and copied commands” labs. Every walkthrough captures my real decision making, including the wrong turns that made the right answers possible.
