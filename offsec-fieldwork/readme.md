# OffSec Fieldwork

This repository contains real-world penetration test simulations, offensive security labs, and vulnerability analysis projects. Each entry is a hands on engagement designed to replicate the tools, thinking, and process of active red team operations, adapted for a home lab and legal testing environments.

## Purpose

To demonstrate practical offensive security skills through structured, documented fieldwork. These aren't passive walkthroughs, theyâ€™re active engagements that include recon, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting.

## Structure

Each subdirectory is a separate engagement or themed exercise.
