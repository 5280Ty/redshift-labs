# Redshift Protocol - Web App Pentest Report

**Target**: OWASP Juice Shop <br>
**Date**: 2025-05-03 <br>
**Analyst**: Taiwan <br>
**Environment**: Local instance / TryHackMe <br>
**Objective**: Identify and exploit at least 3 vulnerabilities, collect flags, assess vulnerability chaining, and gather intelligence.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This engagement targeted OWASP Juice Shop - an intentionally vulnerable web application used for training and testing. The goal was to conduct a red team-style recon and exploit campaign, uncovering critical vulnerabilities and extracting key data points. Four flags were recovered during initial recon, with more vectors identified for future escalation.

---

## 2. Reconnaissance & Mapping

### Tools Used:
- Firefox Dev Tools
- Manual URL fuzzing (`/admin`, `/ftp`)
- Basic endpoint enumeration

### Discovered Endpoints:
- `/#/login` 
- `/#/search?q=` - **Injection suspected**, needs further probing
- `/#/ftp` - Open directory with quarantined files

### Headers Observed:
- None displayed via Dev Tools. Will capture via Burp Suite in next engagement.

### Initial Recon Flags (captured mid-recon):
1. **Error Handling** <br> 
   `169940f83378cc420ae4fdeb9c1f73631a2baee6`

2. **Confidential Document** <br>
   `edf9281222395a1c5fee9b89e32175f1ccf50c5b`

3. **MC SafeSearch Login** <br>

## 3. Observations & Enumeration

### Product Reviews (Intel Gathering)
Several product pages include comments revealing user accounts and attacker taunts. These were used to build a preliminary target list:

| Email Address              | Notes                                               |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| uvogin@juice-sh.op         | Hacker style (Leet), mocks app security                     |
| admin@juice-sh.op          | Likely high-value target                            |
| jim@juice-sh.op            | Neutral tone, Star Trek reference , Jim?                  |
| bender@juice-sh.op         | Mocking Tone, Multiple reviews. Pizza                     Planet? |
| mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op  | Critical lead, password intel exposed                      |
| morty@juice-sh.op          | Referenced app exploitation. Where's Rick?                        |

### FTP Directory Traversal
Manually navigating to `/ftp` revealed open file access:

- **Directory contents**:
  - `acquisitions.md` - Confidential M&A info (This document is confidential! Do not distribute!)
  - `legal.md` - Filler data
  - `announcement_encrypted.md` - Encrypted, inaccessible
  - `coupons_2013.md.bak, `incidentsupport.kdbx, `encrypt.pyc, etc.

- Notable File:
  - `juicy-malware` repo at `https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-malware`
    - Contains harmless malware samples
    - Useful for reverse engineering practice
    - Includes hashes for integrity verification

> **Lesson learned**: Always verify hashes, even in CTFs.

### Login Recon
Using intel from a product review video, the following password was inferred:

- **User**: mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op  
- **Password**: `Mr.N00dles` (vowel-to-zero obfuscation)

Login successful. Basket empty. No further information found.

## 4. Analysis & Next Steps

### What Worked:
- Manual recon uncovered four flags without needing automation.
- Email/password enumeration was successful using contextual clues.
- FTP exposure led to access of multiple files, some containing sensitive info.

### Whatâ€™s Next:
- **Module 2 postponed** to next Juice Shop session (time constraints).
- Further work needed on:
  - **XSS** (blanked during this run)
  - **Burp Suite** interception
  - **FFUF** fuzzing for hidden paths and parameters
- Attempt deeper access or escalation paths via known email accounts.

## 6. Operational Notes

- **Juicy-Malware Repo**: Revisit this for malware analysis practice
- **XSS Research**: Prioritize for next session
- **Burp Suite**: Run full proxy trace, intercept auth tokens, log headers
- **FFUF**: Begin wordlist fuzzing (`admin`, `config`, `backup`, etc.)
