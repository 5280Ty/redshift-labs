# redshift-labs

Redshift Labs is my personal workspace meant to be a living record of infrastructure design, system hardening, network engineering, and cybersecurity experimentation. 
It represents my approach to building, breaking, and refining systems with the same discipline found in production environments.

The repository is divided into two main sections:

1. infra-projects - Infrastructure and Systems Engineering

This section covers real-world system administration and network projects, focusing on reliability and security. Projects include hardware upgrades, virtualization builds, VLAN isolation, SSID management, and service deployment across a home lab that mirrors enterprise conditions. System design and hardening follow principles aquired from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

2. offsec-fieldwork - Red Team Lab

A collection of controlled offensive security environments designed for hands-on practice with vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and mitigation. These labs focus on web application flaws, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and threat emulation within isolated network segments. Each lab's methodology is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to highlight specific techniques and lessons learned rather than just outcomes.

Together, these projects form a cohesive blueprint for modern IT operations and cybersecurity readiness. They provide the necessary foundation to test techniques spanning the MITRE ATT&CK framework (Offense) against controls defined by the NIST CSF (Defense).
