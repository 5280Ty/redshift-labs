## Objective

Transform a budget Acer laptop into a high-performance Linux machine suitable for:

- Productivity
- Cybersecurity labs
- Content creation
- Writing

Maintain a polished, stable daily driver environment without compromising utility or flexibility.

## Hardware Overview

**Model:** Acer Aspire A315-58-59TK  

**Original Specs:**

- RAM: 8GB (4GB soldered + 4GB DIMM)  
- Storage: 256GB SSD  

**Current Specs:**

- RAM: 20GB (4GB soldered + 16GB DDR4 3200MHz)  
- Storage: 1TB SSD  

**Planned Upgrade:**

- 36GB RAM (32GB DIMM supported unofficially)  

---

## Actions Taken

- Replaced factory SSD with 1TB for ample storage.  
- Upgraded RAM to 20GB; confirmed unofficial support up to 36GB via chipset documentation and community forums.  
- Installed **Pop!_OS 22.04** for its stability, hardware support, and clean interface based on GNOME.
- Disabled Secure Boot (reapplied twice due to BIOS quirks).  
- Installed core productivity and creation software:  
  - **LibreOffice, Manuskript, Ghostwriter, Geany/Vim**  
  - **Darktable, Flowblade, Scribus**  
- Added cybersecurity essentials: **Wireshark, OWASP ZAP, Nmap**, and supporting toolkits.  
- Configured **Timeshift** for weekly snapshots, ensuring a safety net during experimentation.  

---

## Outcomes

- Pop!_OS runs smoothly and quickly on budget hardware.  
- Drivers worked out of the box; only minor BIOS/Secure Boot issues encountered.  
- Verified that manufacturers often understate hardware limits; unofficial RAM upgrades are viable.  
- Laptop serves as both a polished daily machine and a capable cybersecurity lab.  

---

## Lessons & Observations

- BIOS settings may not save the first attempt; double-check after reboot.  
- Linux installation in 2025 is smoother than ever, except on Apple hardware.  
- This machine enables writing, testing tools, scripting, and lab experiments all in one setup.  
- Achieving 36GB RAM in a sub-$500 laptop is cost-effective and far exceeds expectations for budget builds.

## Final Notes

Pop!_OS balances refinement and power better than most distributions. While I don’t worship System76, their engineering is respected.  

Until then, this Acer laptop is sufficient: it respects user control, does not require proprietary accounts, and does not enforce unexpected updates.
