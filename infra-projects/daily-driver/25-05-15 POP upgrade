# POP_! OS Upgrade Raw Notes
## The Problem
- I know the new Pop os version has been released. I wanted to see if the upgrade from 22.04 to 24.04 was available yet On POP_! OS.
1. First off, now is a great time to make sure Backups are occurring on time. The backup program Timeshift is timeshifting. Backups occorring weekly and saving
2. Updated all packages on the Cosmic Store
3. Settings> OS Upgrade and Recovery. Upgrade not available. Attempted a recovery, Recovery failed, could not initiate OS Recovery 
4. I knew that this was the ***"easy way"***, it's time to do this right. Time for a command line install (like a badass).
5. Opening the COSMIC Text Editor.
6. I ran the command sudo apt update && upgrade
7. While attempting to update  
E: The repository 'https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/bookworm-team/bookworm/ubuntu jammy Release' does not have a Release file.  
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.  
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.
8. Followed the link to the repository index. I followed the bookworm ppa to the parent directory.The parent directory shows the related project is the bookworm app and not any Debian Bookworm related dependencies.
9. I said (to myself) I will do this the right way, but I have to check something. 
10. Opening the Software and Updates app. I could easily delete the this ppa (or repository) from here, but I decieded to do this the right way so...
11. Back to the command line.sudo ppa-purge ppa:launchpadcontent.net/bookworm-team/bookworm/ubuntu
12. sudo: ppa-purge: command not found. sudo 
13. sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:launchpadcontent.net/bookworm-team/bookworm/ubuntu
14. Unable to handle repository shortcut 'ppa:launchpadcontent.net/bookworm-team/bookworm/ubuntu'
15. Running ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d
16. Returned: bookworm-team-ubuntu-bookworm-jammy.list  pop-os-apps.sources  pop-os-release.sources  system.sources
17. Double checking everything before moving to this solution. error found. Running sudo apt install ppa-purge.
18. Running sudo ppa-purge ppa-launchpadcontent.net/bookworm-team/bookworm/ubuntu
19. Returned Updating packages lists
E: The repository 'https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/bookworm-team/bookworm/ubuntu jammy Release' does not have a Release file.
Warning:  apt-get update failed for some reason
20. OK, enough is enough. I did want to do this at the command line. I know that running sudo rm -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bookworm-team-ubuntu-bookworm-jammy.list will absolutely work, it will also likely create more messes and headaches down the road. To the GUI Software & Updates (like less of a badass)
21. Removing ppa through Software & Updates. Done
22. Checking by running ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d
23. Returned  bookworm-team-ubuntu-bookworm-jammy.list  bookworm-team-ubuntu-bookworm-jammy.list.save  pop-os-apps.sources  pop-os-release.sources  system.sources
24. Ran Sudo Apt Update just to check nothing had changed. Update Failed.
25. Attempting through Software & Updates one last time.
26. Returned bookworm-team-ubuntu-bookworm-jammy.list  bookworm-team-ubuntu-bookworm-jammy.list.save  pop-os-apps.sources  pop-os-release.sources  system.sources
27. Running sudo rm -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bookworm-team-ubuntu-bookworm-jammy.list
28. Returned rm: remove regular empty file '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bookworm-team-ubuntu-bookworm-jammy.list'? (answer y).
29. Running. sudo apt update.  Successful
30. Running sudo apt upgrade. Done
31. Closing all open running applications due to a past bug in upgrading Pop. Running sudo pop-upgrade release upgrade.
32. Returned checking if pop-upgrade requires an update (notihng else)
33. Powercycling laptop

43. System changes observed. Software & Updates is missing from the OS. Opening Repoman.Repo settings confirmed.
44. Opening Bookworn, bookworm operational. All systems appear to be recovered and working properly.
45. Checking for Timeshift logs. Timeshift not found on os.
46. Attempting to download Timeshift from the COSMIC Store. Cosmic Store is gone as are all apps installed through the COSMIC Store (flatpack). Opening pop!_shop.
47. Downloading COSMIC Store. I will not reinstall the cosmic apps as none were much better that what they are intended to replace. I will risk having to fix this issue in the future,so i can update apps quickly,instead of using pop!_shop. Its the worst.
48. Updating through pop_shop
49. one last try at it. Running  pop-upgrade release upgrade
50. returned -- checking if pop-upgrade requires an update
